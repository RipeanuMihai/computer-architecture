    Benefits of Virtual Memory:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Memory management
        \item Protection
        \item Share memory
        \item Process reallocation
        \item Process creation and start up time (without loading the entire process in memory)
    \end{itemize}
    The process of getting the physical address from the virtual address is called translation.
    The virtual memory replacement is done by the operating system.

    \frametitle{Allocation Policies}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Paged virtual memory: The virtual memory is divided into pages.
        \item Segmented virtual memory: The virtual memory is divided into segments.
        \item Combined virtual memory: The virtual memory is divided into segments of size multiple of page size.
    \end{itemize}
    The miss penalty is the time to get the page from the disk, so the operating system must minimize the number of misses.
    There is a full associativity type of memory, where the page can be placed anywhere in the main memory.

    \frametitle{TLB vs MMU}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Specialized cache for speeding up virtual to physical address translation.
            \item Stores recent translations.
            \item Checked first during address translation.
            \item Very fast, small size.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Memory Management Unit (MMU)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Hardware component for managing memory and caching operations.
            \item Translates virtual addresses to physical addresses using page tables.
            \item Handles page faults and memory protection.
            \item More complex and integrated into the CPU.
        \end{itemize}
