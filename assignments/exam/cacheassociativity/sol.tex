\textbf{Problem}
We have a cache with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only one cache level
    \item Main memory access time: 120 cycles $L_{MM}=120$
    \item Main memory byte transfer time: 12 cycles $BT_{MM}=12$
    \item Cache hit time: 4 cycle $H_{C}=4$
    \item Cache miss rate: 5\% $MR_{C}=0.05$
    \item Cache block size: 16 bytes $BS_{C}=16$
    \item Cache size: 64 KB $S_{C}=64 \times 1024$
    \item Cache is Direct Mapped
\end{itemize}

What is the speedup in average memory access time (AMAT)  when the cache becomes 4-way set associative reducing the miss rate $MR_{NC}=0.02$, but the new cycle is double in time compared to the initial cache?

\textbf{Solution}
To calculate the speedup in AMAT, we need to determine the AMAT before and after changing the cache to 4-way set associative and then compute the speedup.

1. Calculate the initial miss penalty:
\[
\text{Initial miss penalty} = L_{MM} + \left(\frac{BS_{C}}{BT_{MM}}\right)
\]
\[
\text{Initial miss penalty} = 120 \text{ cycles} + \left(\frac{16 \text{ bytes}}{12 \text{ cycles/byte}}\right) = 120 + 16 = 136 \text{ cycles}
\]

2. Calculate the initial AMAT:
\[
\text{Initial AMAT} = H_{C} + (MR_{C} \times \text{miss penalty})
\]
\[
\text{Initial AMAT} = 4 \text{ cycles} + (0.05 \times 136 \text{ cycles}) = 4 + 6.8 = 10.8 \text{ cycles}
\]

3. Calculate the new miss penalty:
\[
\text{New miss penalty} = L_{MM} + \left(\frac{BS_{C}}{BT_{MM}}\right)
\]
\[
\text{New miss penalty} = 120 \text{ cycles} + \left(\frac{16 \text{ bytes}}{12 \text{ cycles/byte}}\right) = 120 + 16 = 136 \text{ cycles}
\]
In the number of cycles for the first cache.
4. Calculate the new AMAT:
Since the new cycle time is double that of the initial cache, the new hit time will be $2 \times H_{C} = 2 \times 4 = 8$ cycles.
\[
\text{New AMAT} = 8 \text{ cycles} + (0.02 \times 136 \text{ cycles}) = 8 + 2.72 = 10.72 \text{ cycles}
\]

5. Calculate the speedup:
\[
\text{Speedup} = \frac{\text{Initial AMAT}}{\text{New AMAT}}
\]
\[
\text{Speedup} = \frac{10.8 \text{ cycles}}{10.72 \text{ cycles}} \approx 1.007
\]

Therefore, the speedup in average memory access time (AMAT) when the cache becomes 4-way set associative, reducing the miss rate to 0.02 but doubling the cycle time, is approximately 1.007.
