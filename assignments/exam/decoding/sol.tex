\section*{Problem}
Having the memory addressing table and instruction format tables, what instruction type has the following coding IR=\texttt{0x0140}?

\section*{Solution}


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{OPC}: \texttt{0000\_000}
    \item \textbf{d}: \texttt{1}
    \item \textbf{MOD}: \texttt{01}
    \item \textbf{REG}: \texttt{000}
    \item \textbf{RM}: \texttt{000}
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Identify the isntruction from the opcode using the instruction format table and the memory addressing table}.:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{MOV} is encoded as \texttt{000} when $IR_{1}=0$, $IR_{3}=0$, $IR_{0}=0$, and $IR_{2}=0$.
    \item $d$ is \texttt{1} and $REG$ is \texttt{000} so destination register is \texttt{RA}.
    \item $RM=IR_{13:15}=000$ and $MOD=IR_{8:9}=01$ so the addressing mode is \texttt{[BA+XA+]}.
\end{itemize}

The instruction is \texttt{MOV RA, [BA+XA+]}.

Type of the instruction is \texttt{MOV}.
